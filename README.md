**Proposal: Web3 Library**
- Centered around writers and academics that want to publish their work and recieve compensation. This would create a platform for writeres and academics to generate written content and make profits via crypto/coin, if they so choose. 
- A marketplace for literature but also pairing as a publishing company and offical library vendor for when ALA & other academic/public libraries want to goet on board with Blockchain and NFTs.
- Eventually, create the library in the Metaverse that digitally houses all collections 

**Official About**
  At Lib3, we are excited to introduce ground level and experienced researchers to Blockchain Technology. Lib3’s vision is centered around providing writers and researchers, from every industry, with the ability to publish their work on the Blockchain and receive compensation for their hard work. Our platform is a DeFi marketplace, publishing company and official library vendor for peer-reviewed literature. 

**About In-Depth**
  The purpose of Lib3 is to provide a Web3 marketplace and publishing company for academic writers and researchers to receive the necessary compensation for the time and hard work that they put into their research. More times than not, when researchers are chosen to publish in peer-reviewed journals, these prestigious journals do not compensate researchers for that work. Nor do they receive royalties for each journal that is distributed to their members. Our platform would open up a door for researchers in every industry to not only publish, but receive compensation and royalties from their peers for the hard work they’ve done. In 10 years, our company will be the epicenter, the go-to Web3 marketplace for peer-reviewed journals, articles  and research. 

**What Are You Building?**
  We want to build a marketplace and publishing company centered around writers, academics, and researchers that want to publish their works on the Blockchain and receive compensation through coin/crypto//token transactions. This platform would invite writers and researchers to publish written content and generate profits via coin/crypto//token, if they so choose. 
  
**Why are you building this, what painpoint does it solve and why are you well equipped to do it**
  Oftentimes, when researchers are chosen to publish in peer-reviewed journals, journals do not compensate researchers for that work. Nor do they receive royalties for each journal that is distributed to their members. Our platform would open up a door for researchers in every industry to not only publish, but receive compensation and royalties from their peers for the hard work they’ve done. 
  My team and I are quipt to do this because collectively, we have __ years of experience working in Information Sciences (public & academic libraries, community organizations) and working side-by-side with said researchers. As a collective, we have __ degrees (1 PhD, _Masters, _ Bachelors, _Associates) from _ Universities. We have experience and connections within universities such as Harvard University, Delaware State University, University of Tennessee, University of Tennessee Knoxville, Lincoln University, San Jose State University, Liberty University, Xavier University of Louisiana, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, LeMoyne-Owen College, and Pellissippi State Community College. Additionally, as a collective we regularly attend state and national library conferences and present research. 
  
**Who are your potential competitors and how will you win?**
  Potential competition includes current journals and publishing companies. Currently, these companies are not applying Blockchain to their systems, protocols, policies and procedures.They haven’t realized the potential that Blockchain Technology & Web3 has in the hands of their target audience. We’ll win because we know what their target audience wants and will be on the ground talking to their target audience, as a big company, this is something they’re not doing. 

**What unique insight do you have about where the world is headed, and what does your company look like in 10 yrs if all goes well?**
Blockchain is still in its infancy stages and we are early. We understand that there is so much hesitation around Blockchain tech but years ago, there were questions and doubts surrounding the idea of the internet and social media. In 10 years, our company will be the epicenter, the go-to for peer-reviewed journals and research in Web3.
