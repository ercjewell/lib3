# libweb3
**Proposal: Web3 Library**
- Centered around writers and academics that want to publish their work and recieve compensation. This would create a platform for writeres and academics to generate written content and make profits via crypto/coin, if they so choose. 
- A marketplace for literature but also pairing as a publishing company and offical library vendor for when ALA & other academic/public libraries want to goet on board with Blockchain and NFTs.
- Eventually, create the library in the Metaverse that digitally houses all collections

**Soma Fellows Questions**
1. Give a few lines on what you're building (or would build)
- An NFT Marketplace centered around writers and academics that want to publish their work. 

2. Why are you building this, what painpoint does it solve and why are you well equipped to do it!
- Academic writers and reserachers tend to not get compensated fairly for their published works. Prestegious journals 

3. Who are your potential competitors and how will you win?
- Big publishing companies, if the realize the great potential that Blockchain Technology & Web3 have. 

4. What unique insight do you have about where the world is headed, and what does your company look like in 10 yrs if all goes well?
- In 10 years, our company could be the epicenter of peer-revieved pubslish works in academia. 

5. What's your "go to market" strategy how do you plan to acquire or grow your users/customers, or how fast are you already growing?
- Conferences. American Library Association, Music LA, Special LA, state Library Associations
- I am an Information Professional with a Masters of Science, Infomation Science & 10+ years of Information Science (public & academic libraries) expereince with connections within academic libraries such as Harvard University, Delaware State, University of Tennessee, and other accredited library association. I regularly attend library conferences and present research. Spreading the word about a platform that could pay researchers for thier work in academia would catch fire rather quickly. 
6. Do you have revenue, users or customers?

7. How do you measure success?

8. If N/A, what metric are you going to use for measuring growth, and why is that a good metric?
