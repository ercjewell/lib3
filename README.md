# libweb3
**Proposal: Web3 Library**
- Centered around writers and academics that want to publish their work and recieve compensation. This would create a platform for writeres and academics to generate written content and make profits via crypto/coin, if they so choose. 
- A marketplace for literature but also pairing as a publishing company and offical library vendor for when ALA & other academic/public libraries want to goet on board with Blockchain and NFTs.
- Eventually, create the library in the Metaverse that digitally houses all collections
